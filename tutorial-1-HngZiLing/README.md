## Question-1

Write a Java program to calculate the area of triangle. The area is calculated based on the width and height input by a user (from keyboard).
If the input (width or height) is less than __TWO (2)__ or more than __TEN (10)__, then the user MUST input again. The Java file MUST be named as `AreaTriangle.java`

### Example of the output
```
Please enter the width: 5
Please enter the height: 8
The area of triangle: 20
```

## Question-2

Write a Java program using `for` statement to display all odd numbers between X and Y. The value of X and Y will be input by a user (from keyboard). 
If the difference between X and Y is less than __FIVE (5)__ or more than __TEN (10)__, then the user MUST input again. The Java file MUST be named as `OddNumbers.java`

### Example of the output
```
Please enter X: 10
Please enter Y: 19
Difference: 9
11
13
15
17
19
```
